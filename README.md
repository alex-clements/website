# Website

This is my personal website. I've designed to look like an old operating system so I can show off some of my work and let you know a bit about myself!

## Tech
I used the following libraries / frameworks for the frontend:
- React for updating the DOM
- Framer Motion for all animations found on the page
- Bootstrap for some of the CSS formatting - mostly to do with the layout

## Functionality

I've built in abilities to open files on the desktop and in the documents folder.  Files can also be dragged around and moved from the desktop to the documents folder and vice-versa.  All open windows can be resized, maximized, minimized and closed. Clicking the icon in the task bar at the bottom of the screen will open / un-minimize the corresponding window.
